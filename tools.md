# Tools

Code and pipelines developed in the PrangeLab are openly available on GitHub → [prangelab](https://github.com/prangelab).  
Our tools support reproducible, large-scale transcriptomic and epigenomic analyses.

## Featured Repositories

- **scRNA-seq_helper_functions** — utility functions for single-cell RNA-seq analysis  
- **coloRspacer** — lightweight color palette generator for reproducible plotting  
- **omnomnomics_BASH** — modular Bash pipeline for omics data processing

## Focus Areas

- Single-cell and spatial transcriptomics  
- Epigenomics (ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq, CUT&Tag)  
- Functional genomics (CRISPR screens, perturb-seq)
