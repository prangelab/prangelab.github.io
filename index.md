# PrangeLab

The PrangeLab studies how interplay between immune and stromal cells shapes the development and persistence of cardiometabolic disease.  
We focus on immune cell activation, transcriptional regulation, and epigenetic control of inflammation, combining experimental and computational approaches.  
Our work integrates single-cell and spatial transcriptomics with bulk epigenomic assays such as ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq, and CUT&Tag to understand how chromatin landscapes guide inflammatory states in obesity, atherosclerosis, and related metabolic disorders.  
Based in the Department of Experimental Vascular Medicine at Amsterdam UMC, we have access to large patient cohorts and human tissue biobanks, enabling advanced translational research that connects molecular findings to human disease.  
Our goal is to link molecular regulation of immune cells to systemic disease mechanisms.
