## Principal Investigator

**Koen H.M. Prange, PhD**  
Assistant Professor, Department of Experimental Vascular Medicine, Amsterdam UMC

Koen’s research focuses on how epigenetic and transcriptional mechanisms regulate immune and stromal cell function in cardiometabolic disease. His work combines CRISPR-based perturbation screens, single-cell and spatial transcriptomics, and integrative bioinformatics to uncover regulatory pathways driving chronic inflammation.

Before founding PrangeLab, Koen completed his PhD at Radboud University, where he was supervised by Dr. Joost Martens in the department of Prof. Henk Stunnenberg. His doctoral research focused on the epigenetic regulation of myeloid cells and leukemogenesis in acute myeloid leukemia. He later joined the lab of Prof. Menno de Winther (Amsterdam UMC), where he contributed to pioneering studies on the single-cell architecture of human atherosclerotic plaques.  
He is currently embedded in the Department of Experimental Vascular Medicine (Amsterdam UMC), working in close collaboration with Prof. Max Nieuwdorp to integrate molecular immunology with large clinical cohorts in cardiometabolic disease. He also serves as a PI within the Horizon Europe MIRACLE Doctoral Network.
